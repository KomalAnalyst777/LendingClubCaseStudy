## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

- What is the background of your project?
This project aims to analyze a loan dataset to understand the factors that contribute to loan defaults. The goal is to identify key indicators that can help lenders assess credit risk and make informed lending decisions.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
The business problem addressed by this project is minimizing financial losses due to loan defaults. By identifying high-risk borrowers and understanding the factors associated with defaults, lenders can develop strategies to mitigate risks and improve their loan portfolio performance.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about thousands of loans, including borrower demographics, loan characteristics, and repayment status. The key variables include:

- **Loan Amount:** The principal amount borrowed.
- **Interest Rate:** The annual interest rate charged on the loan.
- **Term:** The length of the loan repayment period.
- **Grade:** A letter grade assigned to the loan based on its risk assessment.
- **Annual Income:** The borrower's annual income.
- **Home Ownership:** Whether the borrower owns, rents, or has a mortgage on their home.
- **Purpose:** The reason for taking the loan (e.g., debt consolidation, home improvement).
- **Loan Status:** Whether the loan was fully paid or charged off (defaulted).

## Conclusions
- **Income and Interest Rate:** Borrowers with lower income and higher interest rates are more likely to default, indicating a higher risk associated with lending to individuals with limited financial capacity and higher borrowing costs.
- **Home Ownership and Bankruptcies:** Individuals who do not own homes and have a history of bankruptcies exhibit a greater likelihood of default, suggesting that homeownership and past financial behavior are important indicators of creditworthiness.
- **Loan Purpose and Amount:** The purpose of the loan and the loan amount play a significant role in default risk. Small business loans and larger loan amounts tend to be associated with higher default rates, highlighting the need for careful assessment of business viability and borrower repayment capacity.
- **Time and Location:** Loans issued in earlier years (2007-2008) and in certain states (NV, AK, FL) show higher charge-off rates, potentially reflecting the impact of economic conditions and regional variations on loan performance.
